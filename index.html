  <p id="tribute-text">Chester Bennington, born March 20, 1976, was an American singer/songwriter most recognized as frontman for the band Linkin Park, a musical outfit that pushed the boundaries through its blend of nu-metal, alternative and hip-hop genres. More notably, however, was the impact Bennington had on a generation of fans looking for answers as they struggled for help.</p>
<p>In his early life Bennington was subject to sexual harrassment from an older friend, as well as bullying at school, both of which contributed to his decision to turn to drugs and alcohol as a coping mechanism. Bennington combatted his addictions by finding solace in songwriting and drawing. After several unsuccessful music endeavors, he auditioned for what would become known as Linkin Park, a musical group that would go on to accrue numerous awards and multimillion selling albums and singles. Despite Bennington's continued struggles with addiction, he inspired fans worldwide through his openness on his mental health issues. He spoke to a generation of people that went through similar dark times.</p>
